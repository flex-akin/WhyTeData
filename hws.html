                    Every pioneer knows that nurturing a business idea to become a reality is
                    no easy task. It requires a certain level of discipline, and not just
                    determination, to start and sustain a business idea, and make something
                    tangible out of an invention.

                So what does it take to be a business inventor and owner? WhyTeData
Project Lead Kolawole Smith shares his story on what it was like to start
his own business from just an idea.
               </p>
<p>
    The first WhyTeData idea – “Be precise when revealing useful secret,
and use clean data on white paper to do so” The second WhyTeData
idea – “Learn & think in loving and innovative environments, and remain
so, in order to grow and thrive”

          <P>
            After months of business data research, WhyTeData, a UK and Nigerian
            registered workplace, and business innovation company was officially
            registered in Scotland on the 19th July, 2018, with company number –
            SC603004. Having spent some money to keep it active while I continued
            with necessary research with no business operation, I dissolved the
            company due to inactivity on the 14th September 2021, without owing
            the company house a penny. Still on research but with clearer
            directions, WhyTeData was again registered officially in England and
            Wales on the 21st June, 2022 with company number – 14186010 after it
            was registered in Nigeria on the 17th of June with company number –
            1942941, and Nigerian Tax Identification Number – 24267047-0001.
        </p>
        <p>
            For almost two years, out of the four years of sustaining the original data
            idea in 2018, I did paid research to remain relevant, till the workplace
            and business innovation idea was conceived.
        </p>
   
          <p>
            <strong>How was your career before WhyTeData?</strong>
          </p>
           <p>
            My work life began formally
            when I arrived in the UK in 2002, shortly before I did an access course to
            higher education (Advanced Mathematics and Science) at the South
            Bank University, London in 2007. I commenced an HND course in
            Aerospace Engineering at the University of South Wales and finished
            with an equivalent of HNC in 2008, and then commenced my Masters in
            Leadership and Sustainability at the University of Cumbria in England in
            2019, before the pandemic. Prior to that, I did my PRINCE2 Project
            Management certification course in March 2018. As a working class
            person in the UK, I have worked in Engineering firms with Broadway
            Stampling as Robotic operator on the Jaguar Land Rover, and Mercedes
            Benz projects in Milton Keynes, and with Signal House Manufacturing as
            Assembler working on Led Tubes project in Leighton Buzzard; in
            Technology firm with Virgin Media as Technical adviser; in the Health sector with
            the NHS as customer service adviser; in Finance with Virgin Money as
            Customer service adviser. I embarked on going into customer-centric
            roles in my career after my Project Management certification course in England. 
           </p>
         <p>
            <strong>When did you decide that you wanted to start your own company? </strong>
         </p>
            <p>
                I find
more fulfillment helping businesses resolve their complex customers
and clients’ complaints issues in my customer service representative
roles than in controlling robots. Shortly after I moved to Scotland to join
a friend, I registered, and started investing on the business idea I
nurtured before I left England in 2018. I then decided to seek more work
experience in delivering excellent customer service. Finally, during the
autumn season of 2021, shortly after my daughter’s birth, I left well-paying jobs in the UK, with my most recent Virgin Media technical adviser
role, to be with my family in Nigeria, and perhaps establish the business
in the making. It sounds absurd but the sacrifice has yielded greater
dividends than anticipated. It was during my stay that I further
discovered the urgent need for excellent customer service in Nigeria. My
continuous research further inspired me into business and workplace
research, particularly with the aim of resolving employee issues,
precisely in the area of work structure, and process improvement.
            </p>

            <p>
                <strong>Who or what is your inspiration in business? </strong>
            
            </p>
            <p>
                God, as the best salesman,
whose life assurance is unbeatable, inspired me to give good guarantee
and offer. He is my first mentor in business. I also learnt this from Henry
Ford in his approach to business. The business in the making became a
reality shortly after my family attended a business course by Bishop
Oyedepo earlier in 2022. The way the program was structured made me
rethink my approach. I later created an office in our living room when
we relocated, and continue my research there in a small corner, where
it’s obvious to visitors, who must be wondering what is happening in our
flat. It is a quantum leap. My wife seriously encouraged me to continue
likewise till our first project was secured. Tom Peters “Wow Project
Book” further inspire me to have a different view on projects, especially
his quality and excellence notion. My workaholic dad has been my
inspiration as well. Books, articles and anything readable, listenable, and seeable, all constitute my inspiration.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>What specific characteristics does one require to be a business owner?</strong>
            </p>
            <p>
                Just be true to yourself and others. Make amends when the need arises
and don’t be unnecessarily proud when there is need to make
corrections, else you may miss out on useful innovative idea. It was my
open minded approach that aid the creation of our strategy, purpose,
solutions, and how we add value, plus the connection of our product
modular systems. You need hunger to succeed, not a business
background. Read, study and continue learning best business practices.
Most importantly, don’t forget to put people above profit.
            </p>
<p><strong>
    What company’s data do you rely on?
</strong></p>
<p>
    For instance, because I find
Marketline quite good, I use them often, in tracking competitors’
business structure and growth strategies; to access comprehensive
financial deals data along with charts and graph covering M&A, and
private equity, and partnerships and alliances; in forming an
independent opinion about a company’s Mergers & Acquisitions (M&A),
Partnerships & Alliances’ growth strategies through the organic and
inorganic activities undertaken. Other companies include IBISWorld,
FAME, Global Trade Tracker, ALF Connect, Statista, and Global Data to
mention a few.
</p>

<p>
    <strong>What is most difficult in your research experience? </strong>
</p>
<p>
    I enjoyed it but having
to keep paying monthly for data access without the actual business
operation was a concern. Although the information is good value for the
money been paid, one can become easily discouraged if the needed
business direction takes longer than anticipated.
</p>


        <p>
            <strong>
                What is the biggest lesson on your journey?
            </strong>
        </p>
        <p>
            Navigating through, till the ideas became a specific one is the biggest
lesson for me. I leant well enough that you can find a specific path in
business and stand out if you properly align your purpose, strengths, and
habits. The combination of our innovative modular product systems
became a reality when I least expected. I just focused on solving a  
specific business issue when the connections I made suddenly became
applicable in business innovation.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>
                What advice could you give other people starting their own company?
            </strong>
        </p>
        <p>
            Just keep on moving in the right direction. Delegate what is not in your
area of expertise. Focus on your strengths and continue developing
them. Master your big picture strategies and always execute wisely. Do
not forget to keep learning with open mind. You cannot outgrow what
you do not know. If you try it, you will always pay the price of not
learning it at the right time. Never consider giving up.
        </p>  

        <p>
            <strong>
                What startup grant or loan do you receive as support to start your own
business?
            </strong>
        </p>
<p>
    None. As a father and a husband, it’s been God’s provision all the way
and up till now. Thanks to my wife for always encouraging me. I chose to
start small than run into debt. By starting small, I mean you should start
with what you can afford, and make sure you invest any loan you receive
responsibly on your business. I had the advice of my research firm. The
knowledge imparted on me encouraged me to keep my research
focused. 
</p>

<p>
    <strong>
        In what direction would you point those people who do not have the
funds to start their own business?
    </strong>
</p>
<p>
    Start where you are, and gradually, climb up to stay up when you get
there. If you jump to go up, you will not stay there long enough.
Everyone has a starting point either with less than a £100 or more, and
whether it is in your room, on your phone, on the street, or on your
laptop. Someone once said “If you think enough, what you have is
enough”. I started by paying approximately £20 monthly for access to
insightful business data to aid my research. This is not including the  
annual fee to keep the company active with the company house. Think
well enough before starting. <br>
