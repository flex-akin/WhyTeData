                    <li>In our business practice, we do not carry the visible cards and currencies around. Hence
                        the reason <strong>we do not do card verification</strong>  using CVC (Card Verification Code) or CVV (Card
                        Verification Value). </li>
                    <li> Instead, <strong>we do workplace and business currency verification</strong> using CC³VC ™ where C is
                        Culture; C³ is Capacity, Capability, and Competence; V is Verification; C is Code. </li>
                    <li>Our workplace and business currencies are culture, capacity, capability, and competence. </li>
                    <li>This means that we will be using invisible, yet powerful currencies: Culture, Capacity,
                        Capability, and Competence. </li>
                    
                        <br>
                        <strong>Our First Workplace Currency Concept</strong>
                        <br>
                    <li>In the business world, the real currency is made up of Work Culture, Peoples’ Capacity,
                        Capability and Competence. In our business solutions, we will begin with Culture
                        Currency Verification. </li>
                    <li>We all know that being competent is being a specialist in one’s field, so we will end with
                        doing Competence Currency Verification. </li>
                    <li>In our business practice, we will be doing Culture, Capacity, Capability and Competence
                        verification to determine Productivity, Performance and Profit Boost in workplaces and
                        business environments, plus community impact.</li>
                    <li>According to R. Nagarajan and Dr. R. Prabhu, we learnt that capability is the condition of
                        having the capacity to do something while competence is the improved version of
                        capability. </li>

                            <strong>Our Workplace Currency Significance</strong>
                        </p>
                  
                    <p>
                        “The business case for <strong> diversity, equity,</strong> and <strong>inclusion</strong> is stronger than ever, but many companies’
                        DEI programs are stalled or have slipped backward. That is because <strong> intentions</strong> aren’t the same as
                         <strong>execution…</strong> ” – McKinsey.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        “Without a commitment that is above the humans’ goal setting <strong>capacity, practical DEI strategy</strong>  will
        surely fail at <strong>the execution stage</strong>  in workplaces and business environments”
        
                    </p>
                    <li> Our Workplace Currency Significance was derived from connecting the phrase ‘DEI –
                        GRATIA’ (by the Grace of God) inscribed on the oldest currency (£) coins, to the DEI
                        workplace strategy (Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion), then to the phrase “In God We
                        Trust” on the world reserve currency notes $. These combinations show how thorough diversity and inclusion
                    can be achieved with true fairness in our workplaces, only by the grace of God. </li>
                    <li> <strong>Wherever the DEI strategy is successfully executed, a positive work culture 
                      and best business practice must have become predominant. That is, the order of the day.</strong> The workplace currency significance makes the DEI
                        workplace strategy a continuous possibility. It is so obvious that though the DEI – GRATIA
                        was coined before the DEI workplace strategy, both were meant to align with each other,
                        and give the DEI workplace and business strategy more meaning.  </li>
                        <br>

                           <strong> Our Second Workplace Currency Concept</strong>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            “If you make your workforce more diverse and inclusive, you help society while helping
        address challenges of specialization and scarcity” – PwC.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            “Workforce can be made diverse and inclusive for top talent retention, but for sustainable
        process transformation such as recruitment process, the human capacity may not be
        sufficient”
                        </p>
                        <li>
                            A diverse and inclusive workforce help to attract and retain top talents in the war for
        talent, and solve the employee retention and resignation issues
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            We understood from the workplace currency significance, as explained above, that we
        can easily practice the DEI strategy in our workplaces by using DEI – GRATIA inscribed on
        the oldest currency £. 
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Therefore, by using the past to be progressive, wisdom demands that we see the DEI
        workplace strategy and DEI – GRATIA inscription as past secrets, appropriately discovered
        now, and truly necessary for sustainable business growth in the war for talents era. The
        second workplace currency concept proves that only by DEI – GRATIA, which means by
        the Grace of God, can we truly practice Diversity, Equity and Inclusive Strategy in our
        Workplaces. The idea was established using the workplace currency significance as stated
        above.
        </li>
        <br>
        <p>
            <strong>“DEI is good management</strong> – Talent is equally distributed, what is not equally distributed is
        opportunity, exposure and access. Therefore, we need diversity, equity and inclusion to
        truly make our workplace more equitable. At the end of the day, DEI is nothing but good
        management. And if you want to be a manager, you have to learn how to manage across
        difference…I will always be in the business of changing hearts and minds. But I am going
        to start by changing our processes to bring about the change that we want to see” –
        Indhira Arrington, Ares Management’s first global Chief diversity, equity, and inclusion
        officer.

                            Be wise enough to include women in your business strategy. Women’s market is huge!
        Women are great market opportunity! <strong>Women constitute immense profit boost whether
            they are your staffs, clients or customers.</strong>

                            “28 trillion dollars is the worldwide size of the women’s market for goods and services. The
        women’s market for goods and services is more than twice as large as China and India
        combined. WOMEN BUY EVERYTHING. Why is this important? They are your customers.
        Most organizations starting a product design are not focused as much as they should be on
        women as customers. Women are your customers – <strong>are you strategically aligned accordingly?</strong> 
        In US alone, 22 trillion dollars were transferred from women to men in the course of the next
        five years. A lot of these is due to women moving into senior ranks and management
        positions due to men aging faster than women. Baby boomers are aging fast. Men go seven
        years before women do, on average, and so a lot of net worth will go from joint hands or
        men’s hands to women’s hands” – Tom Peters 
                        </p>
        
        <li>
            You must be joking if women are not included in your service-product strategy and
        execution. Doing this helps to achieve inclusive, sustainable business growth.

        </p>
        <li>
            To lay more emphasis, as wise business people, we must use the sensible past to be
        progressive – the inscribed value and virtue of the world reserve currency ($) – TRUST –
        “In God we trust” – and the oldest currency (£) – GRACE – “by the grace of God” in our
        business practices. We must not just trade with the notes and coins but value the virtues
        of the inscriptions and writings on the currencies in our daily business practices.

                The Workplace and Business Significance of the DEI – GRATIA Inscription
            </strong>
        </p>
        
        <p> “Value and Virtue – Grace of God”</p>
        <p>“One way to keep your need for prestige under control is by staying in touch with the things
            that matter to you most in life. Keep focusing on the big picture so it won’t be so hard to stop
            worrying about status symbols when they are holding you back or tripping you up” – Beverly
            E. Jones. </p>
        <li>
            As Presidents, CEOs, COOs, CFOs, Directors, MDs and all, it is high time you learned to
        first acknowledge the GRACE FACTOR in your leadership posts. Knowing that you do not
        have the right to be in your position. And that your placement is not by your own right,
        just as past British kings, those who inscribed DEI – GRATIA on the oldest currency
        admitted that they are not ruling by their own right. You need to know that there are
        people with better credentials than yourself. That mind-set motivates past leaders to
        inscribe DEI – GRATIA on the British coins around four centuries ago. According to them,
        it was placed on the currencies to stop them from being and becoming arrogant leaders. 
        </li>
        <br>
        
        <p>Tom Peters was right when he said that “Quality is the CEO getting restroom duty once a
            month. (Week?)”</p>
        
            <p>For instance, any proud British leader will automatically contradict the foundation of the
                British colony. This is not an idea against any leader. Perhaps the reason one Mayor of
                London once sought spiritual help when gun crime was seriously disturbing the peace of
                the capital. He later became a Prime Minister. </p>
        
                <li>The inscription still remains on the oldest coins till date with REX (King) changed to REG
                    (Queen) and passed unto Queen Elizabeth.
                    It is believed that the first bible version, the King James version, commissioned in 1604
                    and published in 1611 – 17th century – over four centuries – greater than four
                    generations before ours – by sponsorship of King James VI and I – mostly used till today
                    and is still considered the most valued version for use on church altars, and in every church. This same 
                    widely used version was named after one of those Kings who learned how to curb their pride! </li>
        <br>
                    <p>“Wise business execution is to understand that the currencies we so much value and mostly
                        use in trading and doing business were both established on the Grace of God and on Trust in
                        God, hence our business practices should reflect these strong virtues as we use those
                        currencies”</p>
                        <p>This is regardless of what may have happen after that or is now happening anywhere.
                            Foundation of founding fathers stays the same. Heritage is stronger than modernization and
                            civilization put together. 
                            </p>
                            <p>Let’s therefore wisely use the past to be progressive in our business practice.
