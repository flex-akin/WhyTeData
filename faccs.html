                <p><strong> FACC$X™ </strong>is our <strong>TOP SECRET BANK,</strong> where we learn to understand the needs of those who matter in our <strong> workplaces and business environments</strong>, and using what <strong>WE GAIN</strong> to our advantage – our <strong>PROFIT. </strong></p>
                <p>
            Welcome to FACC$X – the Faculty of Advanced Clients, Customers, and $TAFF Xperience. 

                </p>
                <p>
            “The type and amount of Currency you earn solely depend on You and your Staffs, and not on your Clients and Customers – your Clients (your professional customers) and Customers pay your currency while you determine the type ($, £, €, ¥, Naira) and amount of currency they will pay simply by paying HUGE ATTENTION to your staffs” 

                </p>
                <p>
            <strong>Introducing the ‘Card & Currency Concept’ Course</strong>    <br/>
            “#Excitingemployeeengagement is creating a culture of unending Joy for every $TAFF at their workplaces. $TAFF Xperience determines companies’ cash and currency, not clients and customers. A burnout $TAFF can ruin your clients’ relationship with you and cost you billions. Look after your $TAFFS, for they are your most precious Workplace assets, your money makers, your Workforces, and your FORCE for good”  
            </p>
            <p>
            <strong>The first QUIZ</strong>
            <ol>
                <li> 
                Get VISA, MasterCard and American Express cards if you have them or get the image of the one you don’t have online. We’ll be working on the front and back of those cards. Observe the cards yourself and rearrange these numbers accordingly – 3, 4, & 5. 
                </li>            
                <li>
                Get the oldest currency coins, the strongest currency notes, and the world reserve currency notes. Discover the two phrases nearest in meaning – one phrase is on the world reserve currency notes and the other phrase is on the oldest currency coins.

                </li>
            </ol>
            </p>
            <p>
            Hint 1: Start practicing those quizzes the ‘BransonVirgin way’ – “Listen to yourself and others around you; Learn as you practice these two exercises; Laugh with yourself and others and Lead yourself first” 
            </p>
              
            <p>Hint 2: Continue practicing those quizzes the ‘BillMicrosoft way’ – “Applied Speed – Business @ the Speed of Thought” </p> 
            <p>Remember this – “If it’s not fun, it’s not worth doing” – Richard Branson. </p>

           <p> <strong>Course continues…</strong> </p>
           <p> Having learnt all there is to know in business, life and all per time, It’s hi time we DIG DEEPER into the BASICS & FOUNDATION of KEY BUSINESS PRACTICES so we don’t enlist among miserable business people in the information age. </p>
           <p> <strong>FACC$X CURRENCY FACTS</strong>  </p>  

            <ol>
                <li>
                    In our business practice, we don’t do card verification using CVC (Card Verification Code) or CVV (Card Verification Value). Instead, <strong>WE DO currency verification</strong> using 
            (C³VC) ™ where C³ is Competence, Capability & Capacity, V is Verification & C is Code. 
                </li>
                <li>
                <strong>The First Workplace Currency Concept</strong> – In the real business world, your first currency is made up of your Competence, Capability & Capacity. That’s what we will first verify in every Workplace and Business environment.   
                </li>
                <li>
                We all know that being competent is being a specialist in your field, so we’ll commence with Competence, then Capability and Capacity. 
                </li>
                <li> 
                In our business practice, we will be doing Competence, Capability & Capacity Verification for Performance, Productivity & Profit Boost in Workplaces & Business environments.
                </li>

            <p> PLEASE NOTE: This isn’t all about qualifications at all…  </p>
            <li>
                According to R. Nagarajan & Dr. R. Prabhu, we learnt that Capability is the condition of having the capacity to do something and competence is the improved version of capability.  
            </li>               
            <li>
             <strong>Our Workplace Currency Significance</strong> – is from connecting the phrase ‘DEI – GRATIA’ (by the Grace of God) inscribed on the oldest currency (£) coins – to the DEI workplace idea Diversity, Equity and Inclusion – Positive work culture and right business practice with fairness – to the phrase “In God We Trust” on the world reserve currency notes $.
            </li>               
            <li>
            <strong>The Second Workplace Currency Concept</strong> – We can practice DEI idea in our Workplaces by using DEI – GRATIA inscribed on the oldest currency. 
            </li>
            <li>
                On using the past to be progressive, wisdom demands that certain secrets are meant to be disclosed for our benefit, hence DEI workplace idea and DEI – GRATIA inscription are meant to fulfil one another. The second currency concept proves that only by DEI – GRATIA, which means by the Grace of God, can we truly practice Diversity, Equity & Inclusion Culture in our Workplaces. 
            </li>
            
           <center> <strong> “Practicing DEI workplace idea is practicing positive work culture and right workplace practice”</strong></center>
           <br/>
            <li>
                <strong> Practicing DEI Culture in the Workplace Yield Profit 1</strong> – Diversity, Equity & Inclusion Culture Pays! A good example is gender inclusion. Be wise enough to accommodate Gender Inclusion in your workplace. Women’s market is huge! Women are great market opportunity! Women constitute immense profit boost! 
            </li>
            <br/>
           <p>“28 trillion dollars is the worldwide size of the women’s market for goods and services. The women’s market for goods and services is more than twice as large as China and India combined. WOMEN BUY EVERYTHING. Why is this important? They are your customers. Most organizations starting a product design are not focused as much as they should be on women as customers. Women are your customers – are you strategically aligned accordingly? In US alone, 22 trillion dollars were transferred from women to men in the course of the next five years. A lot of these is due to women moving into senior ranks and management positions due to men aging faster than women. Baby boomers are aging fast. Men go seven years before women do on average and so a lot of net worth will go from joint hands or men’s hands to women’s hands” – Tom Peters     
           </p>
            <li>
            You must be joking if women aren’t included in your service/product strategy and execution. This helps to achieve inclusive and sustainable business growth.
           </li> 
           <li>
            <strong>Practicing DEI Culture in the Workplace Yield Profit 2</strong> – According to Gartner, “Attract, engage and retain a diverse workforce – Inspire an increasingly fragmented workforce to become better aligned with the organization's social purpose and financial targets” 
            That’s the right practice of diversity and inclusion with fairness in the workplace for performance, productivity and profit boost.  
           </li>
          <li>
            <strong>The Significance of the DEI – GRATIA and the Dollar Phrase in our business practices</strong> – To lay more emphasis, as wise business people, we must use the sensible past to be progressive – the inscribed value and virtue of the world reserve currency ($) – TRUST – “In God we trust” – and the oldest currency (£) – GRACE – “by the grace of God” in our business practices. We mustn’t just trade with the notes and coins but value the virtues of the inscriptions and writings on the currencies in our daily business practices.   
          </li>
                <li> <strong>The Workplace and Business Significance of the DEI</strong> – GRATIA Inscription – “Value & Virtue – Grace of God” 
                As Presidents, CEO, COO, Directors, MD and all, it’s hi time you learn to first acknowledge the GRACE FACTOR in your leadership post. Knowing that you don’t have the right to be in your position. That your placement isn’t by your own right – just as past British kings, those who inscribe DEI – GRATIA on the oldest currency admit that they aren’t ruling by their own right. That mind-set motivates them to inscribe DEI – GRATIA on the British coins around four centuries ago. According to them, it’s meant to stop them from being and becoming arrogant leaders. Tom Peters was right when he said that “Quality is the CEO getting restroom duty once a month. (Week?)” I strongly believe that disaster will strike if the British PMs believe they’re ruling by their own right. That will signify PRIDE and contradict the foundation of the British colony. That’s why I believe the current British PM wisely sought spiritual help for London during his tenure as the Mayor of London when gun crime was seriously disturbing the peace of the capital. 
                The inscription still remains on the oldest coins till date with REX (King) changed to REG (Queen) and passed unto Queen Elizabeth. 
                It is believed that the first bible version, the King James version, commissioned in 1604 and published in 1611 – 17th century – over four centuries – greater than four generations before ours – by sponsorship of King James VI and I – mostly used till today and is still considered the most valued version for use on church altars and in every church was also named after one of those Kings, those who learn how to curb their pride. 
                </li>
               <center>
                <strong>“Wise business execution is to understand that the currencies we so much value and mostly used in trading and doing business were established on the Grace of God and on Trust in God, hence our business practice should be likewise as we use those currencies” </strong> </center><br/>
            This is regardless of what may have happen after that or is now happening anywhere – foundation of founding fathers stays the same – heritage is stronger than modernization and civilization put together. 
            Let’s wisely use the past to be progressive in our business practice.
                <li>
            <strong>The Workplace and Business Significance of the world reserve currency $ Note</strong> – “Value & Virtue – Trust in God” For whatever reason, “In God we trust” was written on the dollar note – first in the 18th century on coins and then in the 19th century on paper notes. That’s the first and most traded currency on earth. 

                </li>
            We need to re-think our business dealings based on these concepts.
            
                <li>
                <strong>CONCLUSION:</strong> The Workplaces with the strongest DEI Culture actively in practice, enough Competent $TAFFS, and adequate Capable Workforce performing beyond expectation will automatically boost their business profit and revenue.
